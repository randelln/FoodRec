# Food Recognition
This is a machine learning model that is used to detect and recognize food items from the UEC-256FOOD dataset.

## Own Model
In the own model jupyter notebook, you will find my own implementation of a machine learning model, that acheived an accuracy of 56%.

## InceptionV3 Model
In the InceptionV3 model jupyter notebook, you will find a tweaked implementation of the InceptionV3 pre-trained model, that acheived an accuracy of 75%.
